<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

<p>Harry Potter: Harry is the main protagonist. He is orphaned as a baby when his parents, James and Lily Potter, are killed by Voldemort for resisting his attempted takeover of the wizarding world. As a final act of love, Lily protected Harry from Voldemort's curse, an act which saved his life but left him with a lightning-bolt-shaped scar on his forehead. When he arrives at Hogwarts, Harry is sorted into Gryffindor House. The events leading up to the Second Wizard War require him to constantly get into trouble with various authority figures, a trait he inherited from his father. Over the next seven years, he learns more about his parents', grows into an accomplished wizard, and defeats Voldemort.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore: Professor Dumbledore is the headmaster at Hogwarts. An old and powerful wizard, he is kind to the students and offers sincere help. Most students and staff are loyal to him, as they rightfully feel he cares deeply for the school and those within. He was tragically murdered by Severus Snape, though later events reveal he and Snape were working together to get Snape back into Voldemort's graces as a spy. The murder was actually at Dumbledore's request as he was already dying from a fatal curse.</p>
<p>Hermione Granger: The reasonable and logical third of the main characters, Hermione is an exceptional witch who befriends Harry and Ron on the first trip to Hogwarts. A Gryffindor, Hermione begins the series obsessed with following the rules no matter what. However, her friendship with Ron and Harry shows her she can relax, and she becomes integral to various plots as her knowledge of magic is unmatched by her peers. The epilogue shows she has two children with Ron.</p>
